📌 Project Title:
Fine-Tuning BERT for Custom Text Classification

📝 Project Description:
This project involves fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer-based model (BERT) on a custom text classification dataset. The goal is to adapt the general language understanding of BERT to perform accurately on a specific task, such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, or intent recognition. The project also includes label customization and optional deployment as an API.

🎯 Objectives:
Use a pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face Transformers.

Fine-tune it using a labeled, domain-specific dataset.

Replace default labels (e.g., "LABEL_0") with human-readable labels (e.g., "positive", "negative").

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

(Optional) Deploy the model using FastAPI to serve predictions via API.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools: Hugging Face Transformers, Datasets, PyTorch / TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

Deployment (optional): FastAPI, Docker, or Hugging Face Spaces

📂 Dataset:
The dataset contains text samples along with their associated labels. Example format:

Text	Label
"I loved this product!"	positive
"This is the worst service."	negative
Labels are encoded as integers during training (positive = 1, negative = 0), and mapped back for readable output after prediction.

🧠 Model Training Process:
Model used: bert-base-uncased

Fine-tuning performed using the Hugging Face Trainer API.

Custom label mapping applied using label2id and id2label to ensure proper output formatting.

📈 Evaluation:
The model is evaluated using a validation set with the following metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

(Example) The model achieved around 95% accuracy on the validation data.

🚀 Deployment (Optional):
A REST API was developed using FastAPI to allow real-time predictions by sending HTTP requests to the fine-tuned model.
